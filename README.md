# Professional_Website

## Summary
Merely a mock-up website portfolio of my own creation.

## Purpose
My original purpose for this assignment was to practice my html/css/javascript/jquery usage on primarily focusing on a website, rather than creating a program and building a website as a sub-task. And while this assignment has taught me a lot more on front-end development, my worktime became a major detriment to this assignment, as it took months to even get to halfway complete.
This website will still fufill its role as a portfolio website demonstration, at the end of the day.

## Lessons Learned From Assignment
1. What I took from this assignment was that Im quite the perfectionist. It would take days for me to get a portion of the header complete, because of OCD and the ideal that it has to exactly fit my vision. Ive made a few compromises for the sake of time, but it still shows that I need to have either a very good plan for the website or be able to change mindsets and be a bit more flexible.
2. Time management. I was able to both work and code, as well as attend NY computing sessions. Yet, after the holidays, it became hard to get back into that regime.
3. I learned that I quite love back-end development rather than front-end. While front-end has its benefits, it feels like Im much more fufilled when creating a small program than I am creating a small website.
4. I wouldnt mind doing this assignment again. It was quite fun and hopefully the next time won`t take 4-5 months.
