# Professional_Website

## Summary
Mock-up of a professional website portfolio.

## Purpose
My original purpose for this assignment was to practice my html/css/javascript/jquery usage on creating a website, rather than creating a program and building a website as a sub-task. And while this assignment has taught me a lot more on front-end development, my availability to continue creating this website was put to the side in order to focus on my current career and lifestyle adjustment. 

## Lessons Learned From Assignment
1. I had a bit of the perfectionist mindset during the project. It would take days for me to get a portion of the header complete, because of the ideal that it has to exactly fit my vision. I've made a few compromises for the sake of time, but it still shows that I need to have a very good, pre-established layout for the website or to be able to change mindsets and be more flexible.
2. Time management. While working and coding at the same time was doable for the first couple of months, readjustments would prove difficult to manage this workflow. Yet, this gave me a glimpse of what to expect for the projects to come.
3. I learned that while I can create both, I have more of a preference towards back-end development than front-end. While the front-end allows me to create what I visually envision, it feels much more fulfilling when you see a program that you`ve dedicated your time on, fully functioning for the first time.
4. While it felt that I had made significant progress towards learning the front-end development process, I should have followed proper html/css formatting and procedures in creating my personal website.
